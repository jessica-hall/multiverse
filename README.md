Note about data:

This is a SUBSET of the full dataset used in the article.

Data has been prescreened to remove trials with aberrant movements, that exceeded the time
requirments, or were not experimental trials.

For VB1 models, consistency is the dependent variable. It is the measure of whether the participant's
choice matched the bias of the verb on that trial. It is coded as 1 if they match and 0 if they 
do not match.

For VB2, VB3, and VB4 models, MD is the dependent variable. This stands for the maximum
deviation of the mouse trajectory from a straight line from the trajectory's start to end
points for that trial. MDs that are negative mean the trajectory curved in a direction
away from the competitor picture, whereas MDs that are positive curved toward the competitor 
picture. MDs near 0 indicate a relatively straight trajectory.
